F_ED uses query_real_name(), which maybe does not exist in native mode.

make_path_absolute() should be defined in master.c for mudlib.n.

query_wiz_level() in master.c should be replaced by using query_player_level.

shadowing should check arguments etc.

Pattern matching doesn't seem to work any longer.

When resolving functions in find_inherited(), types and arguments should
be tested.

COMPAT_MODE should be renamed to COMPAT_FLAG.

A lot of calls to xalloc() should be replaced with alloca().

Objects that has been swapped will forever allocate swap space (until reboot).

access_check.c uses time(0), which is unportable. It would be better
to use functions in port.c.

Destructing and reloading the master object does not work as wanted. Should
it be allowed ?

The flag O_IS_WIZARD is never set. It is used by the 'wizlist' update
algorithm, so that wizards won't add points.

Are sentences freed twice when destructing objects ? Second time,
no sentences will remain.

Only the first two arguments to efuns have their types checked, and only
at run time. Not at compile time. The data structure should be enhanced.

Can 'user' for a player object be 0 ?

Memory is lost when compilation gives errors.

Should be able to handle empty objects (without programs). Maybe it can ?

Will there be an error in the case of inherit_file != but
num_parse_error > 0 ?
