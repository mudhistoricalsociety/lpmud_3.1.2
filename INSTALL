This is a brief description of how to install LPmud 3.0:

Make a directory 'mud', which contains a dir named 'src', 'bin' and 'lib'.
Move the game driver source (this code) to the src directory.

Edit the Makefile, defining where the lib and bin is. Check definitions
in config.h, most are probably good as they are. The important one is
COMPAT_MODE in config.h. It must be defined to be able to use the 2.4.5 mudlib
or older.

Do 'make install' and 'make install.utils'.

Get a mudlib. The way to do this is to get the source to 2.4.5, which includes
a mudlib in the directory 'mudlib'. Copy all those files into your 'lib'
directory.

Copy the file src/master.c to lib/obj/master.c (in COMPAT_MODE), otherwise
to lib/secure/master.c. Copy the file src/mudlib_simul_efun.c to where
it is supposed to be. That is defined by the function get_simul_efun in
master.c. You will need it only if you still want the "old" and out-of-date
efuns like ls() etc.

Test the game with 'driver -o &'.

If you see the message 'Setting up ipc', then you are up and running.
Test with 'telnet localhost 3000'.

If you want the game to restart automatically, use 'bin/restart_mud'.
